# Interactive Particle Galaxy

## Problem Statement
Many websites are lack interactive, visually appealing elements.  
This project explores how **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** can create an engaging galaxy animation while also including a notes app for interactivity.

## Solution
We built a **Particle Galaxy** with:
- Animated galaxy using `<canvas>`  
- Interactive graphics shuffle section  
- Digital clock  
- Notes app connected to a backend (Render JSON server) using `fetch`, `POST`, and `PATCH`.  

## Team
- Project by: Damaris Kinyanjui.

## Demo
- Frontend (Netlify): https://app.netlify.com/projects/stirring-otter-b1dca8/overview  
- Backend (Render): [API Endpoint Here]

## Problems Faced
- Learning how to connect frontend to backend APIs.  
- Using `fetch`, `POST`, and `PATCH` has been alot tough for me.
- Deploying JSON server on Render.

## Future Plans
- Add galaxy color modes (neon,dark).  
- Add background music.  
- Export animations as GIFs.
